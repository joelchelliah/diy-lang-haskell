# Part 7: Using your language

Congratulations! You have now created your own programming language. It's time to take it out for a spin.

Any programming language with respect for itself needs to have a standard library. This is a collection of useful functions provided along with the language core.

In this section we will create various useful functions, all implemented purely in DIY Lang. No Haskell this time!

For this part, you should consider the provided tests more like suggestions rather than something you *have* to follow. It is your language, after all, and you decide what should be in its library.


## Make it happen!

Good luck!

```bash
stack test
```

## What's next?

You have created a programming language, *and* used it to write some serious code.
If you'd like to wrap up here, that's perfectly fine, and you should be proud of what you have done!

If however, you want more, then move on to [part 8](part_8.md) for some additional final challenges.
