# DIY Lang - Haskell

> batteries not included...

This is a **(WIP)** Haskell port of Kjetil Valle's [diy lang tutorial/workshop](https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lang) which guides you through implementing your own little programming language, from scratch!

## Current status
:exclamation: This project is a **Work in progress**, and is currently not very useful :(

:construction: **Part 1: parsing** almost done! Just missing a few more tests.

...

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, you need to install [The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). If you do not have the **Haskell toolchain** already installed, you can get it via **Stack** by following the description in the link above.

Then go ahead and clone this repo, and let's get started!
```bash
https://github.com/joelchelliah/diy-lang-haskell.git
```

:scroll: Also, this [Haskell Cheet sheet](http://cheatsheet.codeslower.com/CheatSheet.pdf) might come in handy if you are feeling a bit rusty.

## Getting started
The workshop is split up into eight parts, each consisting of an introduction followed by a bunch of unit tests. It is your job to write the code that will make these tests pass . When all the tests pass, you'll have implemented that part of the language!

Run `stack test` from inside the project to run the tests, and get a clue about what you should be implementing next!

I will update this README with more Haskell-specific information as I flesh out this port. But for now, please go see the [README of the original tutorial/workshop](https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lang) for more general information.
