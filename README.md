## DIY Lang - Haskell

> batteries not included...

This is a **(WIP)** Haskell port of Kjetil Valle's [diy lang tutorial/workshop](https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lang) which guides you through implementing your own little programming language, from scratch!

### Getting started
I will update this README with more Haskell-specific information as I flesh out this port. But for now, please go see the [README of the original tutorial/workshop](https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lang) for more general information.
